            <h2> What Are Microgreens?</h2>
            <p>Microgreens are the young and tender seedlings of edible vegetables and flower greens that are  harvested just after the first leaves (cotyledon leaves) have developed. They are sometimes referred to as vegetable confetti!!  <br><br>
            They look like this:</p>

            <h2> Nutritional Value of Microgreens</h2>

            <p>Microgreens are a superfood, packed with nutrients, minerals and antioxidants.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t let their small size deceive you, as their nutrient content is concentrated and can provide up to nine more times the nutritional value than their more mature varieties.  Microgreens will generally only retain their full nutritional potential for several days after harvesting, after which time these nutritional values start to wane and are less beneficial, even if their taste may linger longer. To this end, it is essential that microgreens are eaten as soon as possible after harvesting. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22812633/">Vitamins in microgreens</a></p>
